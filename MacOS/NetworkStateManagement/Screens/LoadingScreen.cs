	/// game itself. Normally one screen will transition off at the same time as
	/// the next screen is transitioning on, but for larger transitions that can
	/// take a longer time to load their data, we want the menu system to be entirely
	/// gone before we start loading the game. This is done as follows:
	/// 
	/// - Tell all the existing screens to transition off.
	/// - Activate a loading screen, which will transition on at the same time.
	/// - The loading screen watches the state of the previous screens.
	/// - When it sees they have finished transitioning off, it activates the real
	///   next screen, which may take a long time to load its data. The loading
	///   screen will be the only thing displayed while this load is taking place.
