    /// In order to play a networked game, you must have a player profile signed in.
    /// If you want to play on Live, that has to be a Live profile. Rather than just
    /// failing with an error message, it is nice if we can automatically bring up the
    /// Guide screen when we detect that no suitable profiles are currently signed in,
    /// so the user can easily correct the problem. This screen checks the sign in
    /// state, and brings up the Guide user interface if there is a problem with it.
    /// It then raises an event as soon as a valid profile has been signed in.
    /// 
    /// There are two scenarios for how this can work. If no good profile is signed in:
    /// 
    ///     - MainMenuScreen activates the ProfileSignInScreen
    ///     - ProfileSignInScreen activates the Guide user interface
    ///     - User signs in a profile
    ///     - ProfileSignInScreen raises the ProfileSignedIn event
    ///     - This advances to the CreateOrFindSessionScreen
    /// 
    /// Alternatively, there might already be a valid profile signed in. In this case:
    /// 
    ///     - MainMenuScreen activates the ProfileSignInScreen
    ///     - ProfileSignInScreen notices everything is already good
    ///     - ProfileSignInScreen raises the ProfileSignedIn event
    ///     - This advances to the CreateOrFindSessionScreen
    /// 
    /// In this second case, the ProfileSignInScreen is only active for a single
    /// Update, so the user just sees a transition directly from the MainMenuScreen
    /// to the CreateOrFindSessionScreen.
