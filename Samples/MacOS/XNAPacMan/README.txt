*******************************
TO INSTALL :
Unzip the archive, and double-click the setup.exe file located in the Install folder. On Windows 7, this should take a minute. On Windows Vista, a few minutes, and on XP, it can take longer or sometimes fail. This is an issue with XNA's built-in installer which I used. If the installer ever fails, try installing the .NET framework and the XNA framework manually, and then re-run the installer. They can be found at (http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=333325FD-AE52-4E35-B531-508D977D32A6) and (http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=80782277-d584-42d2-8024-893fcd9d3e82&displaylang=en) respectively.

ABOUT :
My Pac Man clone is the product of careful research on how the original pac man was made. The AI is described in Ghost.cs and is as faithful as possible to the original. First, it is deterministic. There is no element of randomness in the game. However, the update rate is of 1000 per second, so executing patterns requires perfect accuracy. Secondly, each ghost has its own AI, as in the original, has the same scatter modes and number of scatter modes per level, pretty much everything is there. The only major thing missing is the movies between levels.

Game constants (relative speed of everything, scores, timers etc) were as much as possible taken from reliable sources describing the original game, but where I couldn't get the data I made up values that made the game fun and interesting to play.

Please read his page as there is a very interesting article that he links to about the AI in the game.
