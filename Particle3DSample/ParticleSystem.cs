		// An array of particles, treated as a circular queue.
		ParticleVertex[] particles;


		// A vertex buffer holding our particles. This contains the same data as
		// the particles array, but copied across to where the GPU can access it.
		DynamicVertexBuffer vertexBuffer;


		// Index buffer turns sets of four vertices into particle quads (pairs of triangles).
		IndexBuffer indexBuffer;


		// The particles array and vertex buffer are treated as a circular queue.
		// Initially, the entire contents of the array are free, because no particles
		// are in use. When a new particle is created, this is allocated from the
		// beginning of the array. If more than one particle is created, these will
		// always be stored in a consecutive block of array elements. Because all
		// particles last for the same amount of time, old particles will always be
		// removed in order from the start of this active particle region, so the
		// active and free regions will never be intermingled. Because the queue is
		// circular, there can be times when the active particle region wraps from the
		// end of the array back to the start. The queue uses modulo arithmetic to
		// handle these cases. For instance with a four entry queue we could have:
		//
		//      0
		//      1 - first active particle
		//      2 
		//      3 - first free particle
		//
		// In this case, particles 1 and 2 are active, while 3 and 4 are free.
		// Using modulo arithmetic we could also have:
		//
		//      0
		//      1 - first free particle
		//      2 
		//      3 - first active particle
		//
		// Here, 3 and 0 are active, while 1 and 2 are free.
		//
		// But wait! The full story is even more complex.
		//
		// When we create a new particle, we add them to our managed particles array.
		// We also need to copy this new data into the GPU vertex buffer, but we don't
		// want to do that straight away, because setting new data into a vertex buffer
		// can be an expensive operation. If we are going to be adding several particles
		// in a single frame, it is faster to initially just store them in our managed
		// array, and then later upload them all to the GPU in one single call. So our
		// queue also needs a region for storing new particles that have been added to
		// the managed array but not yet uploaded to the vertex buffer.
		//
		// Another issue occurs when old particles are retired. The CPU and GPU run
		// asynchronously, so the GPU will often still be busy drawing the previous
		// frame while the CPU is working on the next frame. This can cause a
		// synchronization problem if an old particle is retired, and then immediately
		// overwritten by a new one, because the CPU might try to change the contents
		// of the vertex buffer while the GPU is still busy drawing the old data from
		// it. Normally the graphics driver will take care of this by waiting until
		// the GPU has finished drawing inside the VertexBuffer.SetData call, but we
		// don't want to waste time waiting around every time we try to add a new
		// particle! To avoid this delay, we can specify the SetDataOptions.NoOverwrite
		// flag when we write to the vertex buffer. This basically means "I promise I
		// will never try to overwrite any data that the GPU might still be using, so
		// you can just go ahead and update the buffer straight away". To keep this
		// promise, we must avoid reusing vertices immediately after they are drawn.
		//
		// So in total, our queue contains four different regions:
		//
		// Vertices between firstActiveParticle and firstNewParticle are actively
		// being drawn, and exist in both the managed particles array and the GPU
		// vertex buffer.
		//
		// Vertices between firstNewParticle and firstFreeParticle are newly created,
		// and exist only in the managed particles array. These need to be uploaded
		// to the GPU at the start of the next draw call.
		//
		// Vertices between firstFreeParticle and firstRetiredParticle are free and
		// waiting to be allocated.
		//
		// Vertices between firstRetiredParticle and firstActiveParticle are no longer
		// being drawn, but were drawn recently enough that the GPU could still be
		// using them. These need to be kept around for a few more frames before they
		// can be reallocated.
